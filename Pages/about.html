    <p>Hello, my name is Chris and I am a full stack developer!
      I am currently employed as an installation techniciain but would love to start my career in software engineering. 
      I have always been a tech savy person and coding has always caught my interest. Being able to control how a website works and what the user is able to see is awesome!
      My goal is to be employed in this field and create new websites my employer envisions, or fix any bugs!
      A few of my hobbies consists of: cooking, working on cars, and exploring nature.
      </p>
